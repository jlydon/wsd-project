		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>I was born in Harwich Massachusetts in 1986. Some of my first memories are of an 
		apartment we lived in. My parents were very loving and took good care of me. December 26th
		1989, I received a beleted christmas present, as my sister Jamie was born. We continued to
		live in that same apartment until October 4th 1993, when my youngest sister Jenna was born.
		My family decided to keep it clever by having everyone's name start with the letter J (my
		mom's name is Judy and my dad's name is Joe). After Jenna was born it was time to move into
		a bigger place. We bought a house in the same town I was born in and that's where we 
		continued to live for some time. In 2005 I signed up for the Army, and left in August of 
		2006. All my training and my first duty station turned out to be the same place at Fort 
		Sill, Oklahoma. There I was part of a funeral squad that would travel the south doing 
		military burials for veterans. May 2007 I found out that I was on a rapid deployment to 
		Iraq, there I would be firing rockets and missiles in support of ground units. I was moved
		around the coutry a bit as the missions needed and in July 2008 I returned to Fort Sill, 
		where I was promptly put on funeral detail again for the remainder of my active duty 
		career. I started dating a girl whom I had met before I deployed again, and lucky for me, 
		<span id="highlight">Alyssa</span> and I are still together to this day.The last few years 
		I have spent moving to a couple homes here in Oklahoma, trying different jobs, and deciding
		where I want my career to go.</p>
