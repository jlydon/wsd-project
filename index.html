		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>I was born in Harwich Massachusetts in 1986. Some of my first memories are of an 
		apartment we lived in. My parents were very loving and took good care of me. December 26th
		1989, I received a beleted christmas present, as my sister Jamie was born. We continued to
		live in that same apartment until October 4th 1993, when my youngest sister Jenna was born.
		My family decided to keep it clever by having everyone's name start with the letter J (my
		mom's name is Judy and my dad's name is Joe). After Jenna was born it was time to move into
		a bigger place. We bought a house in the same town I was born in and that's where we 
		continued to live for some time. In 2005 I signed up for the Army, and left in August of 
		2006. All my training and my first duty station turned out to be the same place at Fort 
		Sill, Oklahoma. There I was part of a funeral squad that would travel the south doing 
		military burials for veterans. May 2007 I found out that I was on a rapid deployment to 
		Iraq, there I would be firing rockets and missiles in support of ground units. I was moved
		around the coutry a bit as the missions needed and in July 2008 I returned to Fort Sill, 
		where I was promptly put on funeral detail again for the remainder of my active duty 
		career. I started dating a girl whom I had met before I deployed again, and lucky for me, 
		<span id="highlight">Alyssa</span> and I are still together to this day.The last few years 
		I have spent moving to a couple homes here in Oklahoma, trying different jobs, and deciding
		where I want my career to go.</p>

		<h2>My Favorite Game!</h2>
		<img src="images/tf2logo.png" alt="team fortress 2 logo">
		<p class="text-padding">Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play team-based first-person shooter (FPS) multiplayer 
		video game developed by Valve Corporation. It is a sequel to the original mod Team Fortress 
		based on the Source engine. It was first released as part of the video game compilation The
		Orange Box on October 10, 2007 for Windows and the Xbox 360. A PlayStation 3 version then
		followed on November 22, 2007. The game was later released as a standalone package for 
		Windows on April 9, 2008, and for Mac OS X two years later. Team Fortress 2 is distributed 
		online through the Steam system, while retail distribution was handled by Electronic Arts.
		On June 23, 2011, the game became a free-to-play title, supported by microtransactions for
		unique in-game equipment through Steam. The development of Team Fortress 2 is led by John 
		Cook and Robin Walker, who originally created the Team Fortress modification for Quake in 
		1996. The game was announced in 1998, and was first powered by Valve's GoldSrc engine, but 
		this changed as it passed through several different design stages. In 1999, the game appeared 
		to be deviating from its predecessors by pursuing a more realistic and militaristic style of 
		gameplay, but its design metamorphosed over an eventual nine-year development period. The final 
		rendition sports cartoon style visuals influenced by the art of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell 
		and Norman Rockwell and is powered by the Source engine. The game itself revolves around two teams, 
		each with access to nine distinct characters, battling in a variety of game modes set in different 
		environments or maps, often with a factory-warehouse theme. The game is set in an alternate 1968, and 
		is a cartoonish take on Sixties Espionage. The maps and music have a Sixties spy movie feel to them, 
		taking elements from James Bond (especially Doctor No and You Only Live Twice), Get Smart, The Man 
		from U.N.C.L.E, Austin Powers (which itself is a parody of the same generation), and The Avengers. 
		The game also contains elements from Wild West stories, and Westerns, as well as elements from World 
		War 2 movies</p>
